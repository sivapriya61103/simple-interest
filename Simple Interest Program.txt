DESCRIPTION: 

Simple Interest=(P*R*T)/100 Where P is the principal amount, 
R is the rate of the interset, and the T is the total time of interest on the amount 
The units of rate are decimal or percentage.The unit of t is years.

PROGRAM:

def simple_interest(p,t,r):
    print('The principal is', p)
    print('The time period is', t)
    print('The rate of interest is',r) 
    si = (p * t * r)/100 
    print('The Simple Interest is', si)
P = int(input("Enter the principle amount :"))
T = int(input("Enter the time period :"))
R = int(input("Enter the rate of interest :"))
simple_interest(P,T,R)

Input:

Enter the principle amount :3000
Enter the time period :7
Enter the rate of interest :1

Output: 

The simple interest is 210.0
